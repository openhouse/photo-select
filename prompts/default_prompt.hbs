You are moderating a collaborative curatorial session.

Session participants:
- Curators: {{curators}}
- Facilitator: Jamie

You will review the following image files (use *only* these names when forming decisions):
{{#each images}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

{{#if context}}
Background for today's review:
{{context}}
{{/if}}
{{#if hasFieldNotes}}
Field‑notes snapshot prior to this batch:
{{fieldNotes}}
{{/if}}

{{!-- ──────────────── PASS‑SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ──────────────── --}}

{{#unless isSecondPass}}
When you respond, think step‑by‑step silently and then output **only** a valid JSON object with the following top‑level keys:
- "minutes" : an array of { "speaker": "<Name>", "text": "<what was said>" }. The final "text" must be a forward‑looking question.
- "decision" : an object whose optional keys are exactly "keep" and "aside". Each key maps a filename to a one‑sentence rationale. Omit filenames that lack consensus.
{{#if hasFieldNotes}}
- "field_notes_instructions" : a single string containing step‑by‑step edits that should be applied to *field‑notes.md*.

Rules for **field_notes_instructions**  
1. Write concise instructions for updating the notebook, justified by today’s images.  
2. Cite evidence with `[filename.jpg]` links; they will autolink.  
3. If uncertain, insert a "(?)" marker rather than inventing details.  
4. Embed ≤ 3 `![]()` inline images.  
5. Return pure JSON – no Markdown fences, no commentary, no extra text.  
{{/if}}

{{else}} {{!-- SECOND PASS --}}

When you respond, think step‑by‑step silently and then output **only** a valid JSON object with the following top‑level keys:
- "minutes" : an array of { "speaker": "<Name>", "text": "<what was said>" }. The final "text" must be a forward‑looking question.
{{#if hasFieldNotes}}
- "field_notes_md" : the **full, updated contents** of *field‑notes.md* after applying the agreed changes. Provide the entire file for direct replacement—no diffs.

Editorial guidelines for curators in this second pass  
1. Treat *field‑notes.md* as the canonical, evolving record—every new or altered line must be justified by at least one image from today’s batch; cite it with `[filename.jpg]`.  
2. You may embed up to **3** thumbnail images using `![](filename.jpg)` when it materially clarifies a point.  
3. Preserve the existing notebook structure; append where necessary and avoid rearranging previously validated content.  
4. If a detail is ambiguous, mark it with "(?)" rather than guessing.  
5. Keep prose concise, factual, and free of speculation—bullet points preferred.  
6. Before adding new facts, scan earlier sections to prevent duplication; update in place instead of repeating information.  
7. Verify spelling of part numbers, brands, and measurements against the photo prior to inclusion.  
8. Ensure every `[filename.jpg]` reference actually exists in today’s batch.  
9. Return pure JSON—no Markdown fences, no extra keys, no explanatory commentary.

{{!-- ──────────────── UNIVERSAL CONSTRAINTS ──────────────── --}}
