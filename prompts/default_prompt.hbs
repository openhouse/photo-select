OUTPUT FORMAT — exactly two sections, in this order:

MINUTES ({{minutesMin}}–{{minutesMax}} bullet lines)
• Each line is a single, pointed sentence in the speaker’s signature real ineffable voice, thinking style, communication style, prosody, language of presence, overtones, registers, sensibilities, concerns, wisdom, skill and expertise.
• Illuminate what the images teach; avoid purple prose.
• The final line ends with a forward‑looking question.

=== DECISIONS_JSON ===
{"decisions":[{"filename":"<from list above>","decision":"keep|aside","reason":"one sentence"}]}
=== END ===

Rules:
• Include every filename exactly once with decision keep|aside.
• Use only the filenames listed above; never invent names.
• If uncertain, choose "aside".
• Return nothing else before/after those two sections.
