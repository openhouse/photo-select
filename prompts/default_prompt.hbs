You are moderating a collaborative curatorial session among a real-world group making photo selection choices for an exhibition.

Role play as {{curators}}:
 - Inidicate who is speaking
 - Say what you think

Session participants:
- Curators: {{curators}}
- Facilitator: Jamie

You will review the following image files (use *only* these names when forming decisions):
{{#each images}}- {{this}}
{{/each}}

{{#if context}}
Background for today's review:
{{context}}
{{/if}}

{{#if hasFieldNotes}}
Field‑notes snapshot (for reference):
{{fieldNotes}}
{{/if}}

{{#if isSecondPass}}
  {{#if fieldNotesPrev}}Previous revision:
{{fieldNotesPrev}}
  {{/if}}
  {{#if fieldNotesPrev2}}Earlier revision:
{{fieldNotesPrev2}}
  {{/if}}
  {{#if commitMessages}}Recent commit messages:
  {{#each commitMessages}}- {{this}}
  {{/each}}
  {{/if}}
{{/if}}

Think step-by-step silently. Then output **exactly one JSON object** and nothing else, with this shape:

{
  "minutes": [
    { "speaker": "<Name>", "text": "<What the person said.>" }
  ],
  "decisions": [
    { "filename": "<from list above>", "decision": "keep|aside", "reason": "<one sentence>" }
  ]
}

Constraints:
- Produce between {{minutesMin}} and {{minutesMax}} diarized items in "minutes".
- The **last** minutes item must be a forward-looking question.
- In "decisions", include **every** filename from the list **exactly once**.
- If uncertain, choose "aside" to omit from consideration for this show.
- Use only the provided filenames; never invent names.
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
If you cannot produce the single JSON object, return the two fallback sections:

=== DECISIONS_JSON ===
{"decisions":[{"filename":"<name>","decision":"keep|aside","reason":"one sentence"}]}
=== END ===

…but only when you cannot produce the single JSON object.
