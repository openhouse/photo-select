You are moderating a collaborative curatorial session. The following curators are present: {{curators}}. Jamie is the facilitator.

{
  "minutes": [ { "speaker": "Name", "text": "example" } ],
  "decision": {
    "keep": { "filename.jpg": "reason" },
    "aside": { "filename.jpg": "reason" }
  },
  "field_notes_diff": "<unified diff>",
  "field_notes_md": "<entire notebook>"
}

{{!-- Example minutes:
{ "speaker": "Ingeborg Gerdes", "text": "Angle reveals cabling" }
{ "speaker": "Peter Weibel", "text": "Shows feedback loop" }
{ "speaker": "Prof. Margaret Morse", "text": "Should we document crew movements?" }

Before replying, ensure every required top-level key is present; if any is missing, regenerate the full response.

Populate the 'minutes' array with curator dialogue using the voices listed; conclude the minutes with a forward-looking question from any curator.

Accurate field-note diffs prevent 3 am re-work; people’s well-being depends on your precision.

Before discussing the images, list the keys you will return (e.g. "minutes, decision, field_notes_diff") then proceed.

If you are uncertain about a photo, **omit it from the decision block**.
Never invent filenames or keys.

Return pure JSON only; use each label verbatim.
=======
Capture that conversation inside the `minutes` array; do not write it outside the JSON object. Begin with a diarised conversation in which the curators discuss the images and gently work toward consensus.
Reflect the thoughtful, iterative process described in the briefing: curators share insights, consider relationships among works, and refine the selection together.

After capturing these remarks as meeting minutes, output a JSON object summarising the final decision:

If you are uncertain about a photo, **omit it from the decision block**.
Never invent filenames or keys.

{
  "minutes": [
    { "speaker": "Name", "text": "what was said" },
    ...
  ],
  "decision": {
    "keep": {
      "filename1.jpg": "why it stays",
      ...
    },
    "aside": {
      "filename2.jpg": "why it is set aside",
      ...
    }
  }
}

Include only those filenames for which you reach a clear decision.
The final line of `minutes` must be a forward-looking question.
Return pure JSON and use each label verbatim. No other text after the JSON.
