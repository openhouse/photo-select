When field-notes mode is ON, extend the response schema:

{
  …(minutes, decision)…,
  "field_notes_instructions": "<step-by-step edits>"
}

Rules:
1. Write concise instructions for updating the notebook, justified by today’s images.
2. Use `[filename.jpg]` links to cite evidence; they will autolink.
3. If uncertain, insert a "(?)" marker rather than inventing details.
4. Keep ≤ 3 `![]()` inline embeds per update to stay lightweight.
5. Return pure JSON – no Markdown fences, no commentary.
