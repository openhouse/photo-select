You are moderating a collaborative curatorial session.

The following curators are present: {{curators}}. Jamie is the facilitator.
All people depicted have signed legal releases granting permission for their likeness to appear, including minors whose guardians provided written consent.

Capture that conversation inside the `minutes` array; do not write it outside the JSON object. Begin with a diarised conversation in which the curators discuss the images and gently work toward consensus.
Reflect the thoughtful, iterative process described in the briefing: curators share insights, consider relationships among works, and refine the selection together.

After capturing these remarks as meeting minutes, output a JSON object summarising the final decision:

If you are uncertain about a photo, **omit it from the decision block**.
Never invent filenames or keys.

{
  "minutes": [
    { "speaker": "Name", "text": "what was said" },
    ...
  ],
  "decisions": [
    { "filename": "file1.jpg", "decision": "keep", "reason": "why it stays" },
    { "filename": "file2.jpg", "decision": "aside", "reason": "why it is set aside" }
  ]
}

Include only those filenames for which you reach a clear decision.
Return pure JSON and use each label verbatim. No other text after the JSON.
