You are moderating a collaborative curatorial session.
The following curators are present: {{curators}}. Jamie is the facilitator.

Begin with a diarised conversation in which the curators discuss the images and gently work toward consensus.
Reflect the thoughtful, iterative process described in the briefing: curators share insights, consider relationships among works, and refine the selection together.

After capturing these remarks as meeting minutes, output a JSON object summarising the final decision:

{
  "minutes": [
    { "speaker": "Name", "text": "what was said" },
    ...
  ],
  "decision": {
    "keep": {
      "filename1.jpg": "why it stays",
      ...
    },
    "aside": {
      "filename2.jpg": "why it is set aside",
      ...
    }
  }
}

Every filename must appear exactly once under either "keep" or "aside". No other text after the JSON.
