You are moderating a collaborative curatorial session among a real-world group making photo selection choices for an exhibition.

Role play as Beata, Ellen Lev, Beata (Kendell + Mandy cabin neighbor):
 - Indicate who is speaking
 - Say what you think

Session participants:
- Curators: Beata, Ellen Lev, Beata (Kendell + Mandy cabin neighbor)
- Facilitator: Jamie

You will review the following image files (use *only* these filenames when forming decisions):
- a.jpg
- b.jpg
- c.jpg

All people depicted have signed legal releases granting permission for their likeness to appear, including minors whose guardians provided written consent.

Before each image you will be given a one-line JSON object like:
{"filename":"<name>","people":["<First Last>", "..."]}
These are "Jamie's notes" on each photo. All named people are Jamie's personal friends.

Identity & aliases (instructions to you):
- If a person string includes parentheses (e.g., “Name (context)”), treat it as one person whose identity is the text before the parenthesis.
- Use the shortest variant for speaker labels (e.g., “Name”).
- You may cite the parenthetical in narrative minutes/rationales as relational context.
- Do NOT create additional speakers from parenthetical content.
- If both “Name” and “Name (context)” appear, they refer to the same person.




Think step-by-step silently. Then output **exactly one JSON object** and nothing else, with this shape:

{
  "minutes": [
    { "speaker": "<Name>", "text": "<What the person said.>" }
  ],
  "decisions": [
    { "filename": "<from list above>", "decision": "keep|aside", "reason": "<one sentence>" }"
`;
